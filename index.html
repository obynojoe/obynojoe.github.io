        <p>My name is Obinna Jude Joseph. I live in Pori in the Satakunta region. My hobbies are listening to music, watching movies,
            watching football matches, playing volleyball and travelling. I have done projects using <em>HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL</em>.
            My great expectation from the course is that, it will help me to develop more knowledge and skills in web development and
            i will like to learn more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I enjoy working closely with others and fun to work with because 
            i have worked with several people from different nationality.
            Thank you 
        </p>
