<h1>WELCOME TO OBINNA JUDE JOSEPH WEB PAGE</h1>
  <div class="task1">
    <p> My name is Obinna Jude Joseph. I live in Pori in the Satakunta region. My hobbies are listening to music, watching movies,
      watching football matches, playing volleyball and travelling. I have done projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL.
      My great expectation from the course is that, it will help me to develop more knowledge and skills in web development and
      i will like to learn more about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I enjoy working closely with others and fun to work with because 
      i have worked with several people from different nationality.
      Thank you
    </p>
